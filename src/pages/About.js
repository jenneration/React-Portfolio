    <p>Just a small town girl. Living in a lonely world. But seriously....</p>
    <p>
      I'm from Brooklyn, NY, moved around too much and eventually settled in
      D.C.I graduated from the Corcoran College of Art + Design with a
      degree in Fine Art Photography only to realize I hate the part
      about looking for a new job every week. THE NEW PLAN: Code for aliving,
      photograph for pleasure, and get back to finding great places to wander
      around in. &#10084;
