            I'm from Brooklyn, NY, moved around too much and eventually settled in
            D.C.I graduated from the Corcoran College of Art + Design with a
            degree in Fine Art Photography only to realize I hate the part
            about looking for a new job every week. THE NEW PLAN: Code for aliving,
            photograph for pleasure, and get back to finding great places to wander
            around in. &#10084;
