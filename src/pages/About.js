            <p>Just a small town girl. Living in a lonely world. But seriously....</p>
            <p>
              I'm from Brooklyn, NY, moved around too much and eventually settled in
              D.C.I graduated from the Corcoran College of Art + Design with a
              degree in Fine Art Photography only to realize I hate the part
              about looking for a new job every week. THE NEW PLAN: Code for aliving,
              photograph for pleasure, and get back to finding great places to wander
              around in. &#10084;
